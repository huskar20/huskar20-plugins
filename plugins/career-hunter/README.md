# Career Hunter

End-to-end job-search automation for Claude. Interview once, then let Claude
hunt matching roles, submit applications in your name, and keep a Google Sheets
tracker in sync with your Gmail — for any role type (data engineer, security
engineer, PM, designer…), tuned to your titles, salary floor, location, and
work-authorization answers.

## What's inside

| Skill | Invoke with | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **setup** | "set up career hunter" | Guided interview → generates your personal `career-profile.md`, creates the Google Sheets tracker from scratch, configures caps/schedule/notifications, and asks the key safety question: fully-automatic submission, or review-each-application-before-submit. |
| **apply** | "run the job hunt" | Searches LinkedIn Jobs, Indeed, and Greenhouse/Lever/Ashby boards for roles matching your profile, scores them, fills and submits applications (honoring your submission mode), logs every one to the tracker, and reports a summary. |
| **sync** | "sync my job search" | Scans Gmail since the last sync for confirmations, rejections, interview invites, and engaged recruiter threads; appends/updates tracker rows; creates a calendar event for each confirmed interview; and pushes a notification when an interview lands. |

## Requirements

- **Claude desktop app** with the **Claude-in-Chrome extension** connected
  (all form-filling and sheet edits happen in your own Chrome, with your own
  logged-in sessions).
- **Gmail**, **Google Drive**, and **Google Calendar** connectors enabled.
- A resume PDF.

> Installing the plugin only adds the skills — it can't turn connectors on for
> you. The first time you run **"set up career hunter,"** setup checks that
> Gmail, Drive, and Calendar are connected and tells you exactly what's missing
> before continuing.

## Quick start

1. Install the plugin, open a folder you want to use as your job-search
   workspace, and say **"set up career hunter"**.
2. Answer the interview (role, titles, salary, location, work auth, EEO
   defaults, submission mode). Setup creates:
   - `career-profile.md` — your answers; edit it by hand any time
   - `career-hunter-state/` — config and run state
   - a `Job_Search_Tracker` Google Sheet with **Applications, Interview Notes,
     Contacts, and Dashboard** tabs
3. Say **"run the job hunt"** to apply, **"sync my job search"** to reconcile
   Gmail with the tracker — or let setup schedule both.

## Safety model

- Every form answer comes from `career-profile.md` or your resume — nothing is
  ever invented. Unanswerable questions mean the application is skipped and
  flagged, never guessed.
- SSN/DOB/government IDs are never entered. Assessments and video interviews
  are never started. Captchas are never solved. Passwords are never typed —
  only "Continue with Google" SSO, and only if you allowed it in setup.
- "Review before submit" mode keeps a human click on every submission.
- Applications are sent in your name: even in fully-automatic mode, you own the
  results. Check the tracker and summaries regularly.
